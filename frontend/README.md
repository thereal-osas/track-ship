```

2. **Set up environment variables**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Initialize the database with sample data**

```bash
npm run seed
```

4. **Start the development servers**

```bash

```

This will start the frontend development server at `http://localhost:5173`

## Backend Setup

The backend API is in a separate repository/folder. To run the complete system:

1. **Set up the backend** (in a separate terminal/folder):
